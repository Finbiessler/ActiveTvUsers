# ActiveTvUsers

**italic** The project is still developed! 

## Project outlook:
A small java program which interacts with the JSONplacerholderAPI. 

The program fetches and processes data from the JSONplaceholderAPI and puts out the proccessed data to an output file.

The data is a set of comments where the comments of active tv users (indicated by the ending .tv of thier e-mail address) that have commented at least 150 characters get filtered out. Then their names are written to the output file. 

As well as that the the components of the project are also unit tested using testng and mockito as the testing framework.

## What I hope to learn:
  * Introduction to the usage of java as a object-oriented language
  * Learn basic interactions with an API
  * Introduction to work with JSON data
  * Write data to an output file 
  * Writing basic unit tests in java 
    * using the fundamentals of testng
    * using mockito to make development of tests easier
